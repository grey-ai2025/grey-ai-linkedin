## Notes

Stats: 26% of dating app users enhance profiles with AI. AI use in dating jumped 333% (Psychology Today). 60% of shoppers would use AI for Valentine's gifts. But nobody trusts an AI-written love letter. The parallel to work is sharp: people will adopt AI for TASKS but reject it when AUTHENTICITY and JUDGMENT matter.

26% of people on dating apps use AI to write their profiles.

AI use in dating jumped 333% this year.

60% of shoppers would let AI pick their Valentine's gift.

But ask someone if they'd send an AI-written love letter?

Absolutely not.

Isn't that interesting?

People will happily use AI for the setup — the profile, the search, the recommendation. But the moment it matters — the moment trust is on the line — they want a human.

Work is exactly the same.

Your team will use AI to summarize meetings, draft first versions, and crunch data all day long. That's the setup.

But the strategy call? The client negotiation? The hard conversation with a direct report? The judgment call on whether to launch or wait?

That's where they want a human. That's where they want YOU.

The companies getting AI adoption right understand this line.

They're not trying to automate everything. They're automating the setup so their people can show up fully for the moments that matter.

AI literacy isn't learning to use AI for everything.

It's learning exactly where AI stops and you start.

Happy Valentine's Day. Go be irreplaceably human today.

Where do you draw the line between AI and "this needs a human"?
