- Layout: bold_headline
- Headline text for image: "Nobody's helping the people"
- Visual concept: Dark gradient background. A single desk lamp illuminating an empty chair and laptop — sharp spotlight, everything else in shadow. Editorial, slightly moody. The feeling of being left alone with a mandate and no map.

**Format:** Relatable Rant
**Pillar:** AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams + Micro-Automations for Real People
**CTA type:** Awareness → question (drives comments)
**Competitor gap:** Data Society repeats "AI is about people, not technology" 15x/month but never gives those people anything actionable. This post validates the frustration of the person on the receiving end.

Every AI company on LinkedIn says the same thing:

"AI adoption is about people, not technology."

Cool. So where's the help for the people?

Because right now, here's what "investing in people" actually looks like at most companies:

1 → An exec reads a McKinsey report
2 → A Slack message goes out: "We need to start integrating AI into our workflows"
3 → A team lead Googles "how to use ChatGPT for [their job]" at 11pm
4 → Nothing changes
5 → Leadership wonders why "AI adoption stalled"

The problem isn't that organizations forgot about people.

It's that "invest in your people" became a LinkedIn caption instead of an actual plan.

Nobody budgeted for the 45-minute session where a manager learns which tasks AI can actually handle and which ones it'll butcher.

Nobody built the 15-minute exercise where a team tests AI on their real data and sees exactly where it breaks.

Nobody told the team lead WHAT to do on Monday morning.

They just told them AI is important and sent a webinar link.

If your AI strategy ends at "we believe in upskilling" — you don't have a strategy.

You have a belief.

What did YOUR Monday morning with AI actually look like this week?
