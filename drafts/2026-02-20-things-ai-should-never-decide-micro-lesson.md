# Post Draft: 5 Things AI Should Never Decide for You

- **Date:** 2026-02-20 (Thursday)
- **Format:** Micro-Lesson (credibility)
- **Pillar:** Human-AI Collaboration
- **Gap filled:** Existing Human-AI Collaboration content focuses on the positive (how AI helps). This post draws the LINE — what AI should NOT do. Contrarian angle that drives engagement.
- **Target audience:** Professionals using AI daily who haven't thought about where to draw the boundary
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments + saves)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #GreyAI

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: bold_headline
- Headline text for image: "AI should never decide this"
- Visual concept: Dark gradient with a bold red line cutting across the frame — a boundary. Cyan on one side (safe zone), darkness on the other. Sharp, editorial, decisive.
- Background: dark_gradient

## Notes

Most AI content on LinkedIn is "AI can do X, Y, Z — isn't that amazing?" This post flips the script. Drawing boundaries makes Grey AI more credible than the hype merchants. This is the "trusted advisor" positioning — the friend who tells you where to STOP, not just where to start.

AI can do a lot. But here are 5 things it should never decide for you:

1. Who to hire.
AI can screen resumes. It can surface candidates you might miss. But the final call on who joins your team? That requires judgment about culture, potential, and fit that no model can replicate. Use AI to inform the decision, not make it.

2. Whether to send that message.
AI can draft the email. But whether it's the right time, the right tone, and the right message for that specific relationship? That's emotional intelligence. And AI doesn't have any.

3. What your strategy should be.
AI is excellent at analyzing data and surfacing patterns. It's terrible at weighing the politics, the timing, the team dynamics, and the gut instinct that shapes real strategy. Let it do the analysis. You do the thinking.

4. How to deliver hard news.
Letting someone go. Delivering a tough performance review. Telling a client the project is off track. AI can help you prepare. But the delivery requires empathy that only comes from being human.

5. When good enough is actually good enough.
AI will optimize forever if you let it. Five more drafts. Three more analyses. One more revision. Knowing when to stop and ship is a human skill. Don't let AI turn you into a perfectionist with nothing to show for it.

The goal of AI literacy isn't using AI for everything.

It's knowing exactly where the line is.

Where do you draw yours?
