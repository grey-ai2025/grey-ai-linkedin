- **Gap filled:** Zero competitors are addressing healthcare-specific AI adoption. This is a completely open lane for Grey AI.
- **Target audience:** Healthcare administrators, clinicians, health system leaders, health tech professionals
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #HealthcareAI #PracticalAI

**Image suggestion:**

## Notes

Healthcare AI is a wide-open content gap. No Tier 1 competitor touches it. Clinicians have SPECIFIC concerns about AI — patient safety, liability, workflow disruption, EHR integration — that generic "AI adoption" content doesn't address. This post validates their skepticism and positions Grey AI as the only training company that gets it.

Clinicians don't hate AI.

They hate being told to trust something no one explained to them.

I keep hearing the same thing from healthcare teams: "We rolled out an AI tool and nobody uses it."

And leadership's response is always: "We need more change management."

No. You need to answer the questions your clinicians are actually asking:

→ If the AI gets it wrong, who's liable — me or the algorithm?
→ Does this thing actually work with our EHR or is it one more tab I have to open?
→ Was this trained on data that looks like my patient population?
→ Who decided this was a priority — someone who sees patients, or someone who doesn't?

Until those questions get real answers, adoption will stay at 15% no matter how many training sessions you schedule.

Healthcare AI literacy isn't a generic prompt engineering workshop.

It's teaching clinicians how to evaluate AI the same way they evaluate a new treatment → with evidence, with skepticism, and with their patients' outcomes as the only metric that matters.

The organizations getting this right aren't leading with the technology.

They're leading with the trust.

What's the biggest question your clinical team has about AI that nobody's answered yet?
