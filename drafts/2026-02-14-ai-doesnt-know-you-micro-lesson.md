## Notes

Valentine's Day is peak "AI personalization" marketing — AI picks your perfume, your gift, your restaurant. But AI personalization is just pattern matching on your data, not understanding. This post uses the Valentine's hook to teach a broader lesson about AI limitations that applies directly to the workplace.

AI can recommend the perfect Valentine's gift based on your browsing history.

It cannot remember that your partner hates flowers because of a childhood allergy they mentioned once three years ago.

AI personalization is impressive. But let's be honest about what it actually is:

1. It knows your DATA, not you.
AI sees your clicks, your searches, your purchase history. It doesn't see your context. Your partner's browsing history says "running shoes" — AI recommends running shoes. You know they already bought a pair last week. Context beats data.

2. It confuses frequency with preference.
You searched "steakhouse" three times for a work dinner. Now every recommendation assumes you love steak. You're vegetarian. AI optimizes for patterns. You understand exceptions.

3. It can't read the room.
AI will recommend the same "top-rated" restaurant to everyone. You know your partner would rather eat takeout on the couch than sit in a crowded prix fixe dinner on Valentine's Day. That's not data — that's knowing someone.

4. It doesn't update in real time the way you do.
Your friend just went through a breakup. AI will still serve them "Valentine's Deals for Couples!" You'd know to skip the topic entirely. Emotional intelligence isn't in the training data.

This isn't just a Valentine's Day lesson. It's a work lesson.

AI can surface patterns in your customer data. It can't tell you why your biggest client has been quiet for two weeks.

AI can draft a performance review. It can't sense that your team member is burned out before they say it.

The best AI users aren't the ones who trust it most. They're the ones who know exactly where its understanding ends and theirs begins.

What's something AI keeps getting wrong about you?
