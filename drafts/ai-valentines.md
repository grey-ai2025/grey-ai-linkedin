## Draft: Your AI Relationship Is Failing

**Hook rationale:** Valentine's Day timing. Opens with toxic relationship language people instantly recognize — reads like a personal callout before they realize it's about AI. "Codependent or avoidant" does double duty: it's psychologically accurate AND makes people self-identify before they hit "see more."

**Competitor gap this fills:** Every Tier 1 competitor talks about AI adoption in dry, corporate terms ("organizations must invest in people and culture"). Nobody frames it as a personal, relatable dynamic. This post makes the same point — find the right balance between human judgment and AI capability — but makes it *feel* like something you've actually experienced.

You and AI are in a toxic relationship.

It's either codependent or avoidant — and both are failing you.

We see two types of people right now.

Type 1: You handed AI the keys to everything. Vague prompt, hit enter, publish whatever it gives you. No review. No judgment. Just vibes.

Type 2: You won't touch it. "I don't need AI." Meanwhile you're spending 3 hours on something a good prompt handles in 15 minutes.

Both of these are toxic relationships.

The people actually winning with AI right now? They're doing something different.

The sweet spot isn't "AI does everything" or "I do everything."

It's knowing when to lead and when to let AI carry.

This Valentine's Day, fix your AI relationship.

It's not about trust falls. It's about trust boundaries.
