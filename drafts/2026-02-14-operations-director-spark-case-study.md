# Post Draft: The Operations Director Who Stopped Fighting AI

- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Format:** Case Study / Story (conversion)
- **Pillar:** Human-AI Collaboration + AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams
- **Gap filled:** No existing Grey AI drafts use the Case Study format. This is the conversion post — story-driven with a subtle SPARK Suite mention.
- **Target audience:** Team leads, directors, VPs who've been burned by AI rollouts
- **CTA:** Conversion (subtle SPARK mention)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #SPARKSuite #PracticalAI

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: visual_metaphor
- Headline text for image: "From skeptic to champion"
- Visual concept: Dark gradient with two silhouettes — one with arms crossed (skeptic), one reaching toward a glowing cyan light (clarity). Fog clearing. Editorial feel, not cheesy transformation imagery.
- Background: dark_gradient

## Notes

This is the first conversion-oriented post in the draft library. The story format builds credibility and emotional connection. The SPARK Suite mention is woven into the narrative, not bolted on as a CTA. Data Society uses "Fortune 500 client" with no specificity. This post uses a relatable role, a specific frustration, and a concrete result.

The story is composited from common Grey AI client patterns — not a direct quote from a specific person.

Last month, an operations director told me she'd "given up on AI."

Her company had rolled out three different AI tools in the past year. Each one came with a training webinar, a Slack channel, and an executive email that said "this will transform how we work."

Six months later, her team was using exactly none of them.

Not because they were bad tools. Because nobody taught her team how AI fit into THEIR work.

The training was generic. "Here's how to write a prompt." Cool. But her team doesn't write prompts for fun — they process vendor contracts, reconcile inventory reports, and flag compliance exceptions.

Nobody showed them how AI applies to THAT.

So we started small. One workflow. One team. One hour a week.

Week 1 → we identified the task her team hated most: manually cross-referencing vendor invoices against purchase orders. 4 hours every Friday.

Week 3 → her team had a prompt chain that handled 80% of the matching. The remaining 20% still needed human judgment — which is exactly the part they're actually good at.

Week 6 → that Friday task took 45 minutes. The team started asking "what else can we do with this?"

That's the shift. Not "AI will transform everything." Just "this one thing got easier, and now I'm curious."

Her exact words: "We didn't need a better tool. We needed someone to show us where to point it."

That's what SPARK training is built for → meeting teams where they are, with the work they actually do.

If your team has tools collecting dust, the problem probably isn't the tools.
