# Post Draft: The Strategy-Execution Gap

- **Format:** Pattern Interrupt
- **Pillar:** AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams
- **Gap filled:** Data Society pushes enterprise AI strategy but nobody addresses the team-level "now what?"
- **Target audience:** Team leaders, managers, department heads
- **CTA type:** Awareness (question to drive comments)
- **Word count:** ~180

## Notes

Competitors like Data Society are flooding LinkedIn with enterprise AI strategy content — "build your AI roadmap," "assess organizational readiness," "move beyond experiments." All C-suite, all top-down.

Nobody is speaking to the manager who just left the all-hands where leadership said "we're an AI-first company now" and has zero idea what to tell their team on Monday.

This post targets that exact moment.

Your company has an AI strategy.

Your team has no idea what to do with it.

I keep seeing the same pattern:

Leadership buys the tools.
They hire the consultants.
They publish the 47-slide AI roadmap.

Then they tell middle managers: "Roll this out to your teams."

And that manager opens ChatGPT, stares at the blinking cursor, and thinks... "What am I supposed to type?"

No one taught them how to actually use AI for their specific work.

The strategy was top-down.
The confusion is bottom-up.

Here's what actually works:

1 → Pick ONE task your team does every week that's repetitive and low-stakes
2 → Spend 15 minutes building a prompt that handles 80% of it
3 → Share it with your team and let them improve it
4 → Repeat with the next task

AI literacy doesn't start with a strategy deck.
It starts with someone on your team saying "wait, it can do THAT?"

What was the first task you actually automated with AI?
