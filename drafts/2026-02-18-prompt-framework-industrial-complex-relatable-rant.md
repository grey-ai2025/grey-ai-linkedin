# Post Draft: The Prompt Framework Industrial Complex

- **Date:** 2026-02-18 (Tuesday)
- **Format:** Relatable Rant (engagement)
- **Pillar:** Prompting That Actually Works
- **Gap filled:** The first prompting post taught 3 useful patterns. This one clears the noise — calling out the over-engineered framework hype that makes people feel stupid. Anti-hype positioning.
- **Target audience:** Professionals drowning in "ultimate prompt framework" content who feel like they're doing it wrong
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #AITraining

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: minimal_quote
- Headline text for image: "You don't need a framework"
- Visual concept: Light minimal background with a single clean sentence in bold DM Sans. White space dominance. Calm confidence against the noise.
- Background: light_minimal

## Notes

LinkedIn is flooded with "The ULTIMATE Prompt Framework" posts — CRISP, RISEN, CO-STAR, etc. Most of them overcomplicate something simple. This post validates the frustration, debunks the hype, and positions Grey AI as the practical alternative. Pairs well with the earlier prompting micro-lesson.

Can we talk about the prompt framework industrial complex?

Every week there's a new one.

CRISP. RISEN. CO-STAR. RACE. TRACE. SPARK. (Not ours.)

Each one promises to "unlock the full potential of AI" if you just memorize the right acronym.

So you try it. You spend 20 minutes structuring the perfect prompt using the R.I.S.E.N. method.

The AI gives you the same answer it would have given if you'd just... asked clearly.

Here's what's actually happening:

Most prompt frameworks are reverse-engineered from good prompts and turned into acronyms so someone can sell a course about them.

They're not wrong. They're just overbuilt for what most people need.

You don't need a framework. You need three habits:

→ Tell the AI what role to play
→ Give it the specific context it needs (not your life story — just the relevant details)
→ Ask one clear question at a time

That's it. That's the whole framework.

If your prompt is longer than the answer you want, you're overcomplicating it.

The best prompters I know don't use acronyms. They just write like they're giving instructions to a smart person who's never seen their work before.

Clear beats clever. Every time.

What's the most overcomplicated prompt advice you've seen?
