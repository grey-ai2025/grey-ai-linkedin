# Post Draft: Your AI Isn't Hallucinating — Your Spreadsheet Is

- **Date:** 2026-02-17 (Monday)
- **Format:** Relatable Rant (engagement)
- **Pillar:** Data Quality & AI Fundamentals
- **Gap filled:** Only 1 existing draft covers Data Quality. This hits a different angle — blaming the data source, not the user's prompting skills. Complements the "AI Gave Me Garbage" micro-lesson.
- **Target audience:** Anyone who's pasted messy data into ChatGPT and gotten nonsense back
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #GreyAI

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: bold_headline
- Headline text for image: "Your spreadsheet is lying"
- Visual concept: Dark gradient with a glowing spreadsheet grid — half the cells are clean cyan, the other half are glitching, distorted, red-shifted. Data chaos meets clarity. Editorial, slightly ominous.
- Background: dark_gradient

## Notes

The "AI Gave Me Garbage" post teaches people 5 prompting fixes. This post goes one level deeper: the problem isn't always the prompt — sometimes the DATA is broken before AI ever touches it. This is a core Grey AI message that no competitor owns.

Your AI isn't hallucinating.

Your spreadsheet is.

I watched someone paste 2,000 rows of customer data into ChatGPT and ask for "insights." The AI came back with confident, detailed analysis.

Every word of it was wrong.

Not because the AI was broken. Because the data had:
→ 14 different spellings of "California"
→ Revenue figures in three different currencies with no labels
→ 200 duplicate entries nobody cleaned up since 2019

AI doesn't question your data. It trusts it completely. Then it gives you beautifully formatted nonsense with bullet points and a confident summary.

And that's more dangerous than getting no answer at all.

Because a wrong answer that LOOKS professional gets forwarded to leadership. Gets baked into strategy decks. Gets presented to clients.

Here's the rule nobody teaches in AI training:

Before you ask AI to analyze anything, ask yourself → would I trust a new hire to make decisions from this spreadsheet without asking me a single question?

If the answer is no, the spreadsheet isn't ready for AI either.

Clean data in, useful answers out. That's not a prompting skill. That's a data quality habit.

What's the messiest dataset you've ever asked AI to analyze?
