# Draft: "AI Gave Me Garbage" Micro-Lesson

- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Format:** Micro-Lesson (credibility)
- **Pillar:** Data Quality & AI Fundamentals
- **Gap filled:** Data Society talks about AI training at the enterprise level but never actually teaches anything tactical. This post demonstrates practical AI literacy — the stuff that makes someone's Tuesday afternoon better.
- **Target audience:** Individual contributors and team leads told to "start using AI"
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #GreyAI

## Draft

"I tried AI and it gave me garbage."

I hear this every week. And 9 times out of 10, the AI wasn't the problem.

Here's what most people get wrong about bad AI outputs:

1. **You gave it your conclusion, not your context.**
Saying "write me a strategy doc" gives AI nothing to work with. Saying "here's our Q4 data, our three biggest customer complaints, and our budget constraints — draft a strategy" gives it everything.

2. **Your data was a mess before AI ever touched it.**
Inconsistent formatting, duplicate records, outdated entries — AI doesn't clean your data, it amplifies whatever's already there. Garbage in, confidently-worded garbage out.

3. **You asked one mega-question instead of a chain of small ones.**
"Analyze our entire sales pipeline and recommend next steps" → vague output.
"What are the top 3 reasons deals stalled in Q4?" → useful output.
Break the big ask into steps.

4. **You didn't tell it who to be.**
AI without a role is AI without judgment. "You're a senior data analyst reviewing this for our VP" gets dramatically different (better) results than no context at all.

5. **You accepted the first draft.**
Nobody ships a first draft of anything important. Treat AI output like a rough draft from a smart intern — useful starting material that needs your expertise to finish.

The real skill isn't "knowing AI." It's knowing how to set it up to succeed.

Which of these have you been guilty of? (No judgment — we've all done #5.)
