# Post Draft: You're Using AI Wrong (And It's Not Your Fault)

- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Format:** Relatable Rant (engagement)
- **Pillar:** Human-AI Collaboration
- **Gap filled:** Most AI advice is either "use it for everything!" or "be careful!" — nobody explains the two actual modes of working with AI (Centaur and Cyborg) in plain language.
- **Target audience:** Professionals who feel like they're either over-relying on AI or barely touching it, and can't find the middle ground
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #AITraining

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: split_contrast
- Headline text for image: "All or nothing isn't a strategy"
- Visual concept: Split layout — left side dark and chaotic (representing dumping everything into AI), right side clean and structured (representing intentional collaboration). Cyan dividing line. Editorial, minimal.
- Background: split

## Notes

Most people fall into one of two extremes: they either paste their entire project into ChatGPT and pray, or they treat AI like it's radioactive. The real skill is knowing which tasks to hand off completely (Centaur mode) and which to do side-by-side with AI (Cyborg mode). This post names the problem, validates it, and gives people a usable mental model — without jargon overload.

Most people use AI in exactly one of two ways:

They dump everything into ChatGPT and hope for the best.

Or they barely touch it because "it never gives good answers anyway."

Both are wrong. And I get it — nobody taught you the middle ground.

Here's what actually works:

Sometimes you hand AI entire tasks. First drafts. Data cleanup. Meeting summaries. Things where AI does the work and you review it.

Researchers call this Centaur mode — clear division of labor, like a chess player who calculates with an engine but picks the strategy themselves.

Other times, you work with AI inside the task. You write a paragraph, AI suggests a better transition. You outline a plan, AI pressure-tests it. You think out loud, AI organizes your thinking.

That's Cyborg mode — human and AI on the same task, passing the ball back and forth.

The mistake isn't using AI too much or too little.

It's using one mode when you need the other.

Dump a strategy decision into AI with no context? Garbage out.

Manually reformat 200 rows of data you could've handed off entirely? That's just suffering.

The skill isn't "learning AI." It's learning when to step back and when to stay in the loop.

Which mode do you default to — and is it actually the right one?
