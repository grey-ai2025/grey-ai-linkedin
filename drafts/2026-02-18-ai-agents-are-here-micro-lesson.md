Here's what most people missed about AI this month:

1. Spotify is merging 650+ AI-generated pull requests into production every month. Engineers describe what they need in plain text — via Slack — and the agent handles the rest. This isn't a pilot. It's how they build software now.

2. Claude literally drove a rover on Mars. NASA's JPL used AI to plan a 400-meter drive for the Perseverance rover. If NASA trusts AI to navigate another planet, you can probably trust it with your quarterly report.

3. The biggest AI company just published a "constitution" for its AI. Not a marketing doc — a values document used directly in training. AI governance stopped being theoretical.

4. Non-technical teams are building their own tools. Anthropic's latest report says the wall between "coders" and "non-coders" is crumbling. Your ops team might not need engineering tickets anymore.

5. Healthcare orgs are cutting documentation time in half. Banner Health, Flatiron Health, and child welfare platforms are seeing real, measurable time savings — not "AI-powered efficiency" buzzwords.

The pattern? AI moved from "interesting experiment" to "how we work now" — and it happened faster than anyone's training programs kept up with.

Which one surprised you?
