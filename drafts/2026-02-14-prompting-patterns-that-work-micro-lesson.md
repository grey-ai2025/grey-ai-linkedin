- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Format:** Micro-Lesson (credibility)
- **Pillar:** Prompting That Actually Works
- **Gap filled:** Neither Correlation One nor Data Society teaches anyone to actually DO anything with AI. This post gives people three patterns they can use in the next 5 minutes.
- **Target audience:** Individual contributors, team leads, anyone who's stared at a blank ChatGPT prompt
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments + saves)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #SPARKSuite

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: bold_headline
- Headline text for image: "Your prompts are too polite"
- Visual concept: Dark gradient with a sharp cyan cursor blinking against black. Clean, editorial. The feeling of staring at a blank input field — then clarity cutting through.

## Notes

Every competitor talks ABOUT AI adoption at the organizational level. Nobody actually teaches a working professional how to write a better prompt. Data Society's latest post literally says "training that's hands-on and relevant" while offering zero hands-on content. This post IS the hands-on content.

Stop writing prompts like you're emailing your boss.

Most people use AI like it's a Magic 8-Ball → ask a vague question, hope for a good answer.

Here are 3 prompting patterns that get consistently better results:

1. The Role + Context + Task stack.
Don't say "write me a project update."
Say "You're a senior PM reporting to a VP who cares about timelines. Here's the status of our 3 workstreams. Write a 200-word update that flags the one risk she needs to know about."
Same AI. Dramatically different output.

2. The chain-of-small-asks.
One big prompt = one mediocre answer.
Instead: "First, summarize this data. Now identify the 3 biggest outliers. Now explain why outlier #2 matters for our Q1 forecast."
Each step builds on the last. The AI gets sharper as you go.

3. The "draft, don't deliver" mindset.
Stop asking AI for a final product. Ask for a rough draft and tell it what to emphasize. Then edit it yourself.
You'll finish in half the time AND it'll actually sound like you.

The best prompt engineers aren't writing longer prompts.

They're writing clearer ones.

Which pattern are you trying first?
