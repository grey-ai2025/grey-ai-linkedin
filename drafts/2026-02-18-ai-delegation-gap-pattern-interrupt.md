Your team is using AI for 60% of their work.

They're delegating less than 20%.

That's not adoption. That's AI as a fancy autocomplete.

Anthropic just dropped their 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report, and this number should keep every leader up at night.

People are touching AI constantly → rewriting emails, summarizing docs, fixing typos.

But hand it a real task? Let it run a process end to end? Actually save them hours?

Nope.

Because nobody taught them how to delegate to AI. They taught themselves — which means they stopped at "this is neat" and never reached "this changes how I work."

That's not a technology problem.
That's a training problem.

The gap between "using AI" and "trusting AI with real work" is where most teams are stuck right now. And the companies that close it are going to operate at a completely different speed.

Is your team actually using AI or just poking at it?

We built full training courses to close exactly this gap. Sign up for our newsletter and they're yours.
