# AI Productivity Theater - Relatable Rant Post

## Draft Post

I'm so tired of AI productivity theater.

You know what I'm talking about.

That colleague who spent 3 hours "optimizing their ChatGPT workflow" to save 15 minutes on a task they could have finished in 20 minutes without AI.

The manager who mandates AI tools for everything, then wonders why the team is working longer hours instead of shorter ones.

The LinkedIn posts about "10x productivity gains" from people who clearly haven't tried to get AI to write anything useful lately.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: most AI implementations make work harder, not easier.

Because nobody talks about the hidden costs:
→ Learning 47 different prompting "frameworks"
→ Fixing AI outputs that are confidently wrong
→ Explaining to your boss why the "AI solution" needs human supervision anyway

The real productivity win isn't using AI for everything.

It's knowing when NOT to use it.

When to trust your expertise instead of asking ChatGPT to "help you think."

When to just write the email yourself instead of generating 5 drafts you have to edit anyway.

AI works best for the boring, repetitive stuff you hate doing.

Not for the thinking you're actually good at.

What's your biggest AI productivity theater horror story?
