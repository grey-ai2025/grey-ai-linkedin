# 5 Manager AI Adoption Mistakes — Micro-Lesson Post

## Content Gap Addressed
Middle managers are the bottleneck for AI adoption, but competitors only offer top-down strategy content. This post gives managers a practical, shareable playbook.

## Format
Micro-Lesson (credibility)
- "Here's what most people get wrong about [topic]:"
- 3-5 numbered insights, 1-2 sentences each
- Close with "Which one surprised you?"
- 200-300 words

## Content Pillar
AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams

## Draft Post

Here's what most managers get wrong about leading AI adoption:

1. They wait until they're "experts" before talking to their team.
You don't need to master every tool. You need to say "I'm learning this too — let's figure it out together." That one sentence builds more trust than any certification.

2. They roll out AI tools without explaining the WHY.
"We're using this now" creates resistance. "This handles the weekly report formatting so you can spend that hour on analysis" creates buy-in.

3. They measure adoption by logins, not by outcomes.
Nobody cares if 90% of your team logged into the AI tool. The question is: did it actually make anyone's work better? If you can't answer that, you're tracking the wrong thing.

4. They treat AI training as a one-time event.
A 2-hour workshop doesn't build fluency. Build 15 minutes of AI experimentation into your team's weekly rhythm. Small and consistent beats big and forgotten.

5. They forget to ask their team what they actually need.
The best AI use cases come from the people doing the work — not from a strategy deck. Ask your team: "What's the most repetitive part of your week?" Start there.

The managers who get AI adoption right aren't the most technical ones.

They're the ones willing to learn out loud.
