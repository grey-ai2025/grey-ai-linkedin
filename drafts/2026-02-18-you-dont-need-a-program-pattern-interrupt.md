Everyone's selling you an AI program.

6-week bootcamps. Enterprise training tracks. Government-funded initiatives with waitlists and application deadlines.

Meanwhile, you're sitting at your desk on a Tuesday afternoon, staring at a spreadsheet that needs to become a presentation by 3pm.

Here's what nobody tells you:

You don't need a program to start using AI well.

You need 15 minutes and one real task.

Not a hypothetical exercise. Not a sandbox environment. YOUR actual work.

→ That weekly status report you rewrite from scratch every Monday
→ The meeting notes nobody reads because they're 4 pages long
→ The email you've been drafting in your head for two days

Pick one. Open ChatGPT or Claude. Paste in the raw material and say: "Make this clearer and half as long."

That's it. That's your first AI win.

No certificate. No cohort. No waiting for your company to roll out an "AI enablement initiative."

The gap between "AI-curious" and "AI-competent" isn't a 6-week course.

It's one Tuesday afternoon.

What's the first task you'd hand off to AI today?
