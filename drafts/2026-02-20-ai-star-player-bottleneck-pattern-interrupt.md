# Draft: AI Star Player Bottleneck
**Date:** 2026-02-20

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: `bold_headline`
- Headline text for image: "One AI expert isn't a strategy."
- Visual concept: Dark, minimal composition. A single illuminated node connected to a cluster of dim, grey ones — all lines running through the one bright point, creating visible tension. The feeling of a single failure point holding everything together.
- Background: `dark_gradient`

## Notes

**Gap being filled:** Ethan Mollick (and most AI thought leaders) write for individuals and executives making personal AI adoption decisions. Nobody is addressing the team-level bottleneck that emerges when one person becomes the AI expert and everyone else becomes their assistant. Grey AI's SPARK Suite is built precisely for this — team-wide baseline fluency, not solo power-users.

**Why this angle works:** Flatters the reader's intelligence (they're nodding at the headline), then flips their assumption (the expert IS the problem), then gives a concrete reframe with a question that drives comments.

Your team has one person who's amazing with AI.

That's not a win. That's a single point of failure.

When one person becomes the AI expert, everyone else routes work through them. The "AI person" gets overwhelmed. Projects stall waiting for their review. And six months later, your team is no more AI-capable than when you started.

This is the AI bottleneck trap. And most organizations walk right into it.

The fix isn't another tool. It's not hiring more AI talent. It's building baseline fluency across your whole team — enough that every person can use AI confidently in their own lane, without asking for help.

→ One AI expert on a team: a bottleneck with extra steps
→ An AI-literate team: distributed capacity, real speed, no waiting

The question most leaders are asking: "Do we have someone great at AI?"

The question they should be asking: "Can every person on this team use AI in their role — without coming to me first?"

That second question is the one that actually changes how fast you move.

Which one are you asking?
