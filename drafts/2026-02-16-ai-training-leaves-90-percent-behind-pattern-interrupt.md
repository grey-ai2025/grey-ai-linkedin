**Format:** Pattern Interrupt
**Pillar:** AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams
**Content gap filled:** Pluralsight (and most AI training companies) build exclusively for developers. 44% of professionals want to apply AI to their current role — but the training industry assumes "AI skills" means "coding skills." Grey AI fills the gap for the other 90% of the workforce.

53% of professionals say AI is their #1 learning priority for 2026.

So where are they going to learn?

A developer bootcamp?

Here's the problem with most AI training right now:

It's built for engineers.

The platforms, the courses, the certifications — they all assume you write code for a living.

Meanwhile, the marketing director trying to use AI for campaign analysis?

Left Googling "ChatGPT prompts for marketers."

The operations manager who heard AI could save 10 hours a week?

Still copy-pasting into spreadsheets.

The nurse who needs to document patient visits faster?

Given a 47-slide deck about "machine learning fundamentals."

44% of people say their biggest AI goal is applying it to their current role.

Not becoming a data scientist.
Not building neural networks.
Not learning Python.

Just → making AI actually useful for the work they already do.

That's not a skills gap.
That's a training gap.

And until we stop treating "AI literacy" like it's only for the engineering department, most teams will stay stuck pretending they've adopted AI while quietly struggling with it.

Who's building AI training for the other 90% of the workforce?

We are.
