Here's what most managers get wrong about AI adoption:

They master it themselves. Then wonder why nothing changes.

Ethan Mollick's latest research says the managers who thrive with AI are the ones who "know what good looks like" — because that's what lets them delegate effectively.

That logic is correct. But it only works one level deep.

Here's what gets missed:

1 → Your team also needs to know what good looks like.
Without that, they'll either over-trust AI output and ship errors — or refuse to use it at all.

2 → You can't delegate AI tasks to a team that's still afraid of the tool.
One fluent manager and nine hesitant teammates isn't progress. It's a bottleneck with a different name.

3 → AI adoption dies in the middle, not at the top.
The executive is bought in. The frontline doesn't know where to start. The ROI evaporates in that gap.

4 → Individual AI skill and team AI capability are not the same thing.
One is a personal win. The other is a business outcome.

The SPARK Score shows exactly where each person on your team stands across 8 AI competency areas — so you stop guessing and start building.

Which of these four gaps is showing up on your team right now?
