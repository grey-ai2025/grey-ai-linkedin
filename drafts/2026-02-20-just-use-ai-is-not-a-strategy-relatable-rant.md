**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: `bold_headline`
- Headline text for image: "Just use AI" is not a plan."
- Visual concept: Dark gradient. The phrase "just use AI" in large faded grey text, with a bold cyan slash cutting through it. Feels like a policy memo getting corrected. Dry, editorial, a little brutal.
- Background: `dark_gradient`

**Source gap:** Ethan Mollick's top post this week — "just use AI" is a leadership failure (1,732 likes / 195 reposts). He names the disease. We have the cure.

---COPY BELOW---

Your leadership team just sent an all-hands email about "embracing AI."

No training. No plan. No answer to "okay, but how?"

Just vibes and a Slack channel called #ai-tools.

And here's what happens next: your team doesn't transform. They produce 10x more PowerPoints that nobody asked for. They paste AI output into reports without checking it. They burn out trying to figure out on their own what "using AI" even means in their specific job.

Ethan Mollick said it clearly this week: telling workers to "just use AI to do stuff" has never been enough. AI adoption is a leadership problem — not a technology problem.

The fix isn't more tools. It's answering the questions leaders keep skipping:

→ What work should actually change?
→ Where are your people confident, and where are they stuck?
→ What does "good AI use" even look like on your team?

You can't answer those questions with a Slack channel.

The SPARK Score is a free assessment that shows exactly where each person on your team stands across 8 AI competency areas. Start with data. Build from there.

Has your team gotten a real AI strategy — or just a suggestion?
