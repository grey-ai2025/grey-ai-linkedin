# Post Draft: AI Training That Teaches Nothing

- **Pillar:** AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams / Human-AI Collaboration
- **Gap filled:** Data Society's content is all strategic and theoretical — Grey AI owns the practical, skills-based angle
- **Target audience:** Anyone who's sat through bad AI training
- **CTA type:** Awareness (question to drive comments)

## Notes

Data Society and similar competitors position AI training as strategic organizational transformation — readiness assessments, maturity models, advisory frameworks. Their blog literally has titles like "What AI Advisory Really Means Today" and "Building an Enterprise AI Strategy That Actually Works."

Meanwhile, actual humans are sitting through training that teaches them what a large language model is but not how to draft a client email with one.

This post validates that frustration and positions Grey AI as the antidote.

Unpopular opinion: most AI training is a waste of your team's time.

Not because AI isn't worth learning.

Because the training teaches people what AI IS instead of what to DO with it.

Your team doesn't need a 90-minute lecture on neural networks.

They need to know how to:
→ Turn a messy spreadsheet into a clean summary in 2 minutes
→ Draft a first version of that report they've been procrastinating on
→ Pull the actual insight out of 50 pages of survey responses

I've watched teams sit through "AI transformation" workshops and walk out knowing the history of machine learning but still unable to write a useful prompt.

That's not training.
That's a TED Talk with a certificate.

Real AI literacy looks like someone finishing a task in 10 minutes that used to take an hour — and knowing exactly why it worked.

What's the worst AI training you've sat through?
