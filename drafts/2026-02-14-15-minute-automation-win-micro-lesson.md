- **Date:** 2026-02-14
- **Format:** Micro-Lesson (credibility)
- **Pillar:** Micro-Automations for Real People
- **Gap filled:** All competitors focus on enterprise-scale AI transformation. Nobody shows the small, immediate wins that make people actually believe AI is worth their time.
- **Target audience:** Anyone doing repetitive knowledge work — operations, marketing, HR, finance
- **CTA:** Question (drives comments)
- **Hashtags:** #AILiteracy #PracticalAI #AITraining

**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: stat_callout

## Notes

This is the content pillar competitors completely ignore. Correlation One talks about training 20,000 professionals. Data Society talks about organizational readiness. Grey AI talks about what you can do before your next meeting.

Here's what most people get wrong about AI automation:

They think it requires a developer, a budget, and a 6-month implementation plan.

It doesn't.

Here are 3 automations that take 15 minutes to set up and save hours every week:

1. The weekly status report.
Paste your project notes into ChatGPT with: "Summarize these into a 150-word executive update. Flag risks. Keep the tone professional but direct."
You just turned 45 minutes of writing into 3 minutes of editing.

2. The meeting prep brief.
Before any meeting, paste the agenda and attendee list. Ask: "What are the 3 things I should have an opinion on? What question is the VP most likely to ask?"
You walk in prepared instead of scrambling.

3. The inbox triage.
Copy your 10 most recent emails. Ask: "Rank these by urgency. Draft 2-sentence replies for the top 3."
You won't use every reply. But you'll clear your inbox in 10 minutes instead of 40.

None of these require coding.

None of them require permission from IT.

All of them work today, right now, with the free version of ChatGPT.

What's the one task you keep doing manually that AI could probably handle?
