**Image suggestion:**
- Layout: `bold_headline`
- Headline text for image: "$650B on AI. Your team still Googles it."
- Visual concept: Dark gradient with two scales wildly out of balance — one side heavy with glowing infrastructure, the other side a tiny, dim human figure. The absurd contrast between investment and readiness. Editorial, cinematic grain.
- Background: `dark_gradient`

## Notes

**Gap being filled:** Every major newsletter and AI page is posting summit recaps and funding numbers. Nobody is connecting the trillion-dollar infrastructure buildout to the ground-level reality: most teams still don't know how to use the tools they already have. Grey AI can own the "so what does this mean for YOUR team" angle on every big AI news story.

**Why this angle works:** Readers who follow AI news already know the headlines. They don't need another recap. What they want is someone who tells them what it means for their actual work. The contrast between $650B and "your team still can't use ChatGPT" is visceral and shareable.

100+ countries just gathered in New Delhi for the biggest AI summit ever held in the Global South.

Tech CEOs showed up. Heads of state showed up. The number $650 billion got thrown around — that's how much major companies plan to spend on AI infrastructure this year alone.

And yet.

Most teams still can't get their people to use AI for a meeting summary.

The India AI Impact Summit had real substance. Three guiding principles — People, Planet, Progress. Conversations about governance, equity, sustainable compute.

But here's what bothers me:

We keep building bigger AI infrastructure without building bigger AI literacy.

Amazon committed $200B. Google committed $175B. OpenAI signed a $10B compute deal.

That's a lot of horsepower for a workforce that's still figuring out the steering wheel.

The bottleneck in AI adoption was never compute.

It was never the models.

It's the gap between what the tools can do and what your team actually knows how to do with them.

$650B buys a lot of GPUs.

It buys zero AI fluency.

That part's on you.

Is your team's AI literacy keeping pace with the investment your industry is making — or are you falling behind while the infrastructure races ahead?
