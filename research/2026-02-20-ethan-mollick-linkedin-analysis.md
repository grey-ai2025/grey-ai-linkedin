## What's Trending / Getting Engagement

1. **The agentic shift** — "It's not chatbots anymore." AI agents that do multi-step work autonomously are the new dominant narrative. His Feb 18 piece framing AI across Models/Apps/Harnesses is getting heavy pickup.

2. **Management skills as the AI differentiator** — Mollick's thesis that delegation ability (not prompting) determines who succeeds with AI is resonating strongly with leadership audiences. Lots of comments/reposts from executives and HR professionals.

3. **Practical "which tool" guides** — Evergreen high-engagement format. Audiences want concrete recommendations, not abstractions.

4. **The "jaggedness" of AI** — Ongoing thread: AI is superhuman in some areas, useless in others. Uncertainty about where that line is drives engagement.

5. **AI in education** — His BLOOM-AI framework post (May 2025) hit 70K+ impressions, 200+ reposts. Educators hungry for structured frameworks.

## Content Gap Identified

**Mollick talks to individuals and executives. He doesn't address teams.**

His "Management as AI Superpower" piece argues that management skills (clear instructions, evaluation, feedback loops) transfer directly to AI delegation. But his examples are individual experts managing AI agents on solo projects.

**What's missing:**
- How teams redesign workflows when *multiple* people need to use AI together
- What happens when one person on a team is AI-literate and the rest aren't (bottleneck dynamics)
- Practical skill-building frameworks for non-technical frontline employees — not managers
- How organizations measure team-wide AI fluency progress

**The specific gap Grey AI can fill:**
> "Your AI star player is actually a liability" — the trap of having one AI expert on a team instead of building distributed baseline fluency.

This directly maps to Grey AI's SPARK Suite positioning: team-wide AI literacy training, not just individual upskilling. Mollick's audience understands AI's individual potential; they haven't thought through what happens at the team level when adoption is uneven.

## Post Angle Recommended

**Format:** Pattern Interrupt

**Hook:** Flip the assumption that one AI expert = problem solved
**CTA:** End with a question (awareness post)
