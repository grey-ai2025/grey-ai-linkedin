## Content Gap for Grey AI

**What everyone is posting:** Summit recaps, model specs, funding numbers. Pure news regurgitation.

**What nobody is connecting:**
- "100+ countries met to discuss AI governance. Meanwhile, most teams can't get their employees to use ChatGPT for a meeting summary."
- The gap between $650B in infrastructure investment and the actual AI literacy of the workforce that's supposed to use it
- The "Three Sutras" framework sounds nice — but without team-level AI fluency, "People-centric AI" is just a slide deck

**Grey AI's unique angle:**
> The world is investing trillions in AI infrastructure. But infrastructure without literacy is just expensive hardware. The real bottleneck isn't compute — it's competence.
