## Posts Scraped (last 1–2 weeks, sorted by engagement)

### 1. "Corporate 'just use AI' is not enough — it's a leadership problem"
- **Engagement:** 1,732 likes · 163 comments · 195 reposts ⭐⭐ HIGHEST
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** A corporate position that workers should "just use AI to do stuff" has never been enough, a problem getting worse as AI gets better. AI use in companies is also a leadership problem that involves answering fundamental questions about what people should do with their time, how work is organized, and how to center people in work. A failure to do this will result in either a flood of workslop as individual workers produce 10x more PowerPoints/code/reports without actually reconsidering what work is valuable, or else burnout.

### 2. Claude Cowork multi-agent demo (107 documents)
- **Engagement:** 1,874 likes · 183 comments · 99 reposts ⭐⭐ HIGHEST
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** Pointed Claude Cowork at 107 complex documents (PPTs, Word, Excel) from a Wharton business case. In a single run (deploying multiple agents spontaneously), it cracked the case and produced a PowerPoint with recommendations. This gives knowledge workers the "Claude Code moment" — realizing these AI systems have suddenly gotten very good, very quickly.

### 3. Guide to Which AI to Use in the Agentic Era
- **Engagement:** 1,201 likes · 97 comments · 184 reposts ⭐⭐ HIGH
- **Posted:** ~1 day ago
- **Summary:** AI is no longer just about chatbots. Users now need to understand models, apps, and harnesses. Most changes ever in this edition of his guide.

### 4. "Use frontier LLMs when being right matters"
- **Engagement:** 647 likes · 108 comments · 41 reposts ⭐ HIGH
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** If you're in any situation where being right matters, you'd be making a mistake not to ask a frontier LLM (GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6 Thinking, Gemini 3 Pro — yes, you need to pay $20). That means checking your own work, second opinions, getting help with complex problems.

### 5. ByteDance Seedance video model
- **Engagement:** 829 likes · 111 comments · 62 reposts
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** Impressive first-generation results from Seedance 2.0 video model prompts.

### 6. "Don't download unvetted AI skills"
- **Engagement:** 522 likes · 78 comments · 23 reposts ⭐ HIGH
- **Posted:** ~16 hours ago
- **Summary:** Avoid downloading AI skills not vetted through careful reading of markdown files (or by a trusted expert). Obvious security risks, but even greater risk that the skill is just bad and produces worse/more generic results than no skill at all.

### 7. LLMs tripled new book releases; quality fell on average but mid-tier improved
- **Engagement:** 378 likes · 83 comments · 21 reposts
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** Most new AI-assisted entries are "slop," but books ranked 100–1,000 per category are actually better than pre-LLM. Pre-LLM authors got more productive. Filtering is going to be key to benefiting.

### 8. "Most people's 'AI' experience is Siri or off-brand apps"
- **Engagement:** 270 likes · 61 comments · 13 reposts
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** People who know about AI don't realize how much most people's interactions with "AI" are customer service lines, Siri, or off-brand "ChatPT" apps from the App Store. As a result, many people have no idea what a modern frontier model can do, or how much the hallucination and accuracy problem has shrunk.

### 9. Claude Code built and sold a GPT-1 book — 20 min of active work
- **Engagement:** 289 likes · 39 comments · 14 reposts
- **Posted:** ~1 week ago
- **Summary:** Claude Code built 80 volumes containing GPT-1 weights, designed covers, built a website, integrated Stripe + Lulu print-on-demand, and launched it. 20 minutes of active human effort. Sold out same day.

### 10. AI p-hacking / scientific misconduct paper
- **Engagement:** 2 likes (just posted)
- **Posted:** ~3 minutes ago
- **Summary:** Recent AIs resist instructions to p-hack and do good analysis, but the guardrails can be breached.

## Content Gap for Grey AI

### Primary gap: "Just use AI" ≠ AI Strategy — but what DO leaders actually do?
Mollick's single most-engaged post this week names the problem perfectly:
- Leaders telling workers to "just use AI" leads to **workslop** (10x more PowerPoints, no value rethink) or **burnout**
- He frames it as a leadership problem requiring real answers about how work is organized
- **He stops there.** He has no product, no framework, no curriculum to offer.

Grey AI IS the answer. SPARK Suite gives leaders the structured path:
- Assessment (SPARK Score) shows where the team actually stands
- 8 competency areas → targeted training, not generic "use AI more"
- Designed for teams, not just individuals

### Secondary gap: The AI literacy awareness problem
Most employees' "AI" is garbage apps. They've written off the technology before meeting it.
Grey AI's SPARK Score free assessment is the first real step — show people what they don't know.
