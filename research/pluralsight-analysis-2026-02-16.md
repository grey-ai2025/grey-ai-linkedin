## Content Gap Identified

### The Big Gap: AI Literacy for Non-Technical People

Pluralsight's content is **100% aimed at technical professionals** — developers, cloud architects, security engineers, DevOps. Even their AI content assumes the audience writes code.

Their own poll data reveals the disconnect:
- **44% of respondents** want to "apply AI to my current role"
- But Pluralsight only shows them developer-oriented learning paths

**Who Pluralsight completely ignores:**
- Managers and team leads who need to evaluate AI tools
- Operations, HR, marketing, and finance professionals using AI daily
- Healthcare workers adopting AI documentation tools
- Leaders who need to build AI confidence across entire teams (not just the engineering department)
- Anyone who says "I tried ChatGPT and it gave me garbage"

**Why this matters for Grey AI:**
This maps directly to Grey AI's Pillar 5 (AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams) and Pillar 6 (Healthcare AI Literacy). Pluralsight trains the 10% of the workforce that codes. Grey AI trains the other 90%.

### Secondary Gaps
- **No practical prompting content** — They mention "better prompting" once in passing but never teach it
- **No micro-automation wins** — Everything is big enterprise training paths, nothing bite-sized
- **No relatable frustration content** — Tone is too polished to connect with people struggling with AI
- **Zero conversation-driving content** — Max 6 comments on any post despite 231K followers
