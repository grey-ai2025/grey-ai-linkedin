## Recent Posts / Content (Jan–Feb 2026)

### "A Guide to Which AI to Use in the Agentic Era" — Feb 18, 2026
**Subtitle:** "It's not just chatbots anymore"

Key points:
- AI has shifted from conversational chatbots → autonomous agents completing tasks independently
- Introduced a 3-part framework: **Models** (underlying intelligence) / **Apps** (interfaces) / **Harnesses** (systems enabling autonomous task completion)
- "The single most important thing you can do is pick the right model"
- Free models vs paid models ($20+/month) create a meaningful capability divide
- AI is transitioning from "saying things" → "doing things"

### "Management as AI Superpower" — Jan 27, 2026
**Subtitle:** "Thriving in a world of agents"

Key points:
- Management/delegation skills are now the critical AI advantage — not technical ability
- Core delegation math: Human Baseline Time vs. Probability of Success vs. AI Process Time
- GPT-5.2 "tied or beat human experts an average of 72% of the time" on professional tasks
- The key capability: **"knowing what good looks like"** — domain experts can judge AI output, give feedback, catch errors faster
- MBA students built startups in 4 days ("Vibefounding") because they knew their domain
- Constraint isn't talent availability → it's "knowing what to ask for"

### "Claude Code and What Comes Next" — Jan 7, 2026
**Subtitle:** "With the right tools, AI can accomplish impressive things"
- AI as developer tool, agentic systems for multi-step workflows

### "The Shape of AI: Jaggedness, Bottlenecks and Salients" — Dec 20, 2025
- AI performs inconsistently — very strong in some areas, weak in others
- Uneven capability profile matters for task delegation decisions

## Content Gap Identified: Individual Fluency ≠ Team Capability

**What Mollick covers extremely well:**
The individual knowledge worker or manager who learns to work with and delegate to AI. His entire body of work assumes the reader is motivated, self-directed, and operating independently.

**What Mollick almost never addresses:**
- How a manager actually brings their *team* up to speed, not just themselves
- What happens when the leader gets fluent but the team stays stuck
- How organizations build *collective* AI literacy, not just individual skill
- The training/L&D angle: structured, measurable programs vs. self-directed learning

**The specific gap:**
Mollick's "management as superpower" piece argues that experts who "know what good looks like" thrive with AI. But this frame assumes the individual manager is the unit of AI adoption.

In reality, for most organizations, the manager can't delegate AI tasks to teammates who aren't fluent. One AI-literate manager and nine AI-anxious teammates is not an AI strategy — it's a new kind of bottleneck.

**Grey AI's angle:**
SPARK Suite directly fills this gap. Where Mollick addresses individual fluency, Grey AI addresses team-wide AI literacy across 8 competency areas. The SPARK Score gives managers the data Mollick's framework assumes they already have: knowing exactly where each person stands.
