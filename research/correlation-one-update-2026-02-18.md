# Correlation One — Latest Posts Analysis (Feb 2026)

## Posting Activity

**Extremely low frequency.** Only 1 post in 2026 so far (Jordan convening, 5 days ago). Their next most recent original content is 3+ months old.

## What They're Posting

Almost every post falls into one of two categories:

### 1. Program/Event Promotion (~80% of content)
- APEX AI Launchpad (high school students)
- DoD Cyber Sentinel Skills Challenge
- Amazon Career Choice programs (US, UK, Canada, EU)
- Coding competitions with Citadel (Terminal, Datathons)
- Apex AI Championship ($50K prizes for high schoolers)

### 2. Impact Stories / Case Studies (~20%)
- Jordan workforce convening (government partnerships, 4,000+ youth trained)
- Fortune 100 beverage brand AI upskilling ($50M potential revenue growth, 400 employees)
- Amazon Career Choice graduate testimonials
- U.S. Army Career Invitational

## Engagement Analysis

| Post Type | Avg Reactions | Comments | Reposts |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Reposted thought leadership (Deepali Vyas) | **367** | **77** | 29 |
| Program launches (AI Launchpad, Career Choice) | 30-63 | 0-4 | 2-18 |
| Event deadlines / "apply now" | 13-24 | 0-3 | 1-6 |
| Case studies / impact stories | 15-43 | 0-1 | 0-8 |
| White papers / resources | 15-22 | 0 | 0 |

**Key insight:** Their only high-engagement content (367 likes) was a *repost* of someone else's thought leadership — not their own original content. Their own posts rarely break 50 reactions despite having 55K followers.

## Topics Trending on Their Feed

1. **High school AI education** — APEX AI Launchpad is their flagship initiative right now
2. **Government/military workforce** — DoD, Army, Jordan partnerships
3. **Enterprise upskilling at scale** — Amazon, Fortune 100 companies
4. **Responsible/ethical AI** — framed through student education lens
5. **International workforce development** — Jordan, EU, UK, Canada expansion

## What's NOT on Their Feed

- **Zero practical AI tips or how-to content** — no prompting advice, no tool recommendations, no micro-automations
- **No content for individual professionals** — everything is institutional (enterprise programs, government contracts, student competitions)
- **No thought leadership from their own team** — no original perspectives, hot takes, or insights from Correlation One leaders
- **No data quality or "AI fundamentals" content** — they say "AI literacy" but never teach it on LinkedIn
- **No healthcare-specific content** — purely enterprise/government/education focus
- **No content addressing the "overwhelmed worker"** — the person told to "adopt AI" without support

## Content Gap for Grey AI

**The biggest gap: Correlation One talks exclusively to institutions. They never talk to the person.**

Every single Correlation One post is aimed at:
- High school students enrolling in a formal program
- Amazon/enterprise employees in a structured training track
- Government/military through contracted partnerships

They completely ignore the **everyday professional** — the manager, the team lead, the individual contributor — who just wants to get better at AI *right now* without enrolling in anything.

Their implicit message: "AI skills require a formal program."
Grey AI's counter-message: "You can start getting real value from AI in 15 minutes."

This is Grey AI's widest-open lane. Correlation One has the enterprise contracts and government partnerships. Grey AI owns the practical, accessible, "start today" space.

## Tone Comparison

| | Correlation One | Grey AI |
|--|----------------|---------|
| Voice | Corporate/institutional | Smart friend |
| Audience | Enterprises, government, students | Working professionals, teams |
| CTA | "Apply for our program" | "Try this right now" |
| Format | Emoji-heavy announcements | Conversational, pattern-interrupt |
| Engagement driver | Partner amplification | Original thought leadership |
