## Engagement Patterns

**What gets the most LIKES:** Product announcements, geographic expansion
**What gets the most COMMENTS:** Values/governance content, controversial stances
**What gets the most REPOSTS:** Cool stories (Mars rover), model launches, constitution
**What drives the highest comment-to-like ratio:** Values content (constitution = 6% comment rate vs. typical 1-2%)

## Content Format Observations
- Video posts (Mars rover, Spotify) get high reposts
- Values/stance posts drive conversation
- Case studies with specific numbers outperform generic partnership announcements
- Reposting from the @Claude page gives product posts a second life

## Grey AI Angles

### High-Opportunity Topics
1. **The AI Delegation Gap** — "60% using AI, <20% actually delegating" maps perfectly to AI literacy gap. Grey AI's entire value prop lives in this stat.
2. **AI Agents Are Here — Is Your Team Ready?** — Agents going mainstream means teams need training, not just tools.
3. **Healthcare AI Is Moving Fast** — Anthropic posting multiple healthcare pieces. Grey AI's healthcare pillar is timely.
4. **AI Values & Governance** — High comment engagement means audiences care. Grey AI can position around responsible adoption.
5. **The Non-Coder Revolution** — "non-technical teams using agents to build their own tools" — this is SPARK Suite's audience.

### Content Gaps Grey AI Can Fill
- Anthropic posts are about WHAT AI can do. Grey AI can post about HOW to actually use it.
- No practical "here's how your team adopts this" content from Anthropic.
- Healthcare AI posts are aspirational — Grey AI can be the practical voice.
- The delegation gap is identified but not addressed — that's a training problem, not a tech problem.
