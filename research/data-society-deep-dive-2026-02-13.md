## Content Tone & Approach
- Professional, consultative, C-suite targeted
- Heavy on frameworks, readiness assessments, organizational strategy
- "Outcomes over hype" messaging (but still very high-level)
- Emphasis on "people, purpose, and preparation"
- Almost no tactical how-to content for individual contributors

## What's Trending for Them
1. **AI Advisory** — New service line, getting heavy promotion
2. **"Beyond experiments to real results"** — Messaging pivot from "adopt AI" to "make AI actually work"
3. **Organizational readiness** — Data maturity, AI readiness assessments
4. **Predictions content** — 4 separate predictions posts in January alone
5. **Enterprise strategy** — Every post targets decision-makers, not practitioners

## What's Notably Absent
- Zero prompting tips or tactical AI skills content
- No content for individual contributors or team leaders
- No "quick wins" or micro-automation content
- No data quality troubleshooting for everyday users
- No healthcare-specific AI literacy
- No engagement-driving formats (questions, polls, relatable scenarios)
- All top-down, none bottom-up

## The Gap: Strategy-to-Execution Bridge

Data Society tells executives to build AI strategies.
Nobody is helping the team leader who gets told "start using AI" with zero guidance on what to do Monday morning.

**Data Society says:** "Build an enterprise AI strategy that actually works."
**The missing conversation:** "Great, I have a strategy deck. Now what do I tell my 12-person team to actually DO?"

This is Grey AI's lane — practical, team-level AI literacy that bridges the gap between the C-suite strategy and the Monday morning reality.
