## Trending Topics Across the AI Training Space (Feb 2026)

## Identified Content Gap: The Frozen Middle Manager

### The Gap
All three competitors focus top-down: C-suite strategy, enterprise-scale programs, organizational transformation frameworks. **None of them speak directly to the middle manager** who's been told to "figure out AI" with no playbook, no training, and no support.

### Why This Matters
- Middle managers are the #1 bottleneck for AI adoption
- They face pressure from above (deliver on AI mandates) AND below (reassure teams about job security)
- They're expected to champion tools they barely understand
- 68% feel unprepared; only 28% of their direct reports feel supported

### Why It's Perfect for Grey AI
- Fits the "smart friend" voice — empathy + practical help
- Maps to Content Pillars: AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams + Human-AI Collaboration
- The existing "AI productivity theater" draft validated frustration-based content
- None of the Tier 1 competitors own this angle
- Huge audience on LinkedIn (middle managers ARE LinkedIn's core demographic)

### Post Recommendations
1. **Pattern Interrupt** — Bold opener about the "frozen middle" problem, provocative reframe
2. **Micro-Lesson** — "5 things middle managers get wrong about leading AI adoption" (actionable, shareable)
