## Correlation One — Latest Posts

**Posting frequency:** Very low (1 post in last month, then gaps of months)
**Engagement:** Mixed — one viral post (366 reactions, 77 comments) vs typical 14-36 reactions

### Recent Content:
1. **Jordan workforce convening** (1d ago) — Government partnership showcase. 20K+ professionals assessed, 4K youth trained. Corporate PR tone. 33 reactions.
2. **"AI changed the career playbook"** (older, viral) — Provocative take on degrees losing value. 366 reactions, 77 comments. Their best-performing post by far. Used fear-based hook ("They told you to get a degree... AI just changed that playbook").
3. **DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge** — Military cybersecurity competition promo. Transactional.
4. **High School Terminal coding competition** — Citadel partnership. Student pipeline.

### Key Takeaway:
Their ONE viral post (366 reactions) was the most provocative, opinionated, and voice-driven content they've ever posted. Everything else is corporate announcements that get 14-36 reactions on 55K+ followers. **The data proves: opinion and voice >> corporate PR.**

## Data Society — Latest Posts

**Posting frequency:** Daily (5 posts in 3 days)
**Engagement:** Near-zero (0-2 reactions per post, almost no comments)

### Recent Content:
1. **"Why do AI projects stall?"** — Generic advice about people + tools. 0 reactions.
2. **"How are organizations winning with AI?"** — AI bank meeting notes example + Air Force case study. 0 reactions.
3. **"Struggling to embed AI skills daily?"** — Workshop-to-practice gap. 2 reactions.
4. **"Debunking AI adoption myths"** — 5 common myths list. 0 reactions.
5. **CDO Magazine sponsorship event promo** — 17 reactions (boosted by co-hosts).

### Key Takeaway:
Data Society is posting daily and getting **near-zero engagement**. Their content reads like AI-generated corporate filler — no personality, no edge, no specifics. Every post follows the same template: vague problem → obvious advice → "What's your organization doing about X?" They're a cautionary tale of volume without voice.

### Patterns to exploit:
- They use bullet points (LinkedIn penalizes)
- Every post ends with generic engagement bait ("Comment 'READY' for resources")
- Zero concrete examples anyone can relate to
- No personality or humor — pure corporate speak
- They mention "Fortune 500 clients" without any specificity

## Updated Content Gaps (Feb 14)

### 1. Voice is the differentiator
Correlation One's only viral post was their most opinionated one. Data Society posts daily with zero voice and gets zero engagement. **Grey AI's "smart friend" voice is the competitive moat.**

### 2. Specificity beats generality
Data Society says "one Fortune 500 client saw 40% improvement." That's corporate case study speak. Grey AI should say "Last week, a marketing director told me she spent 4 hours writing a report AI could have drafted in 20 minutes. The problem wasn't the AI — it was the prompt." **Specific > impressive.**

### 3. No one is teaching practical skills
Both competitors talk ABOUT AI adoption. Neither teaches anyone to actually DO anything. Every Data Society post could be summarized as "AI adoption is about people, not technology" — and that's it. They never show you HOW.

### 4. Healthcare still wide open
Zero healthcare AI content from any competitor.

### 5. Engagement bait doesn't work
Data Society's "Comment READY for resources" / "Comment ADOPT" gets zero response. Genuine questions ("What was the first task you actually automated?") from Grey AI's existing drafts are better.
