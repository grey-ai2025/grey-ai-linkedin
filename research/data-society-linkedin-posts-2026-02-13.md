### Engagement Patterns
- **Highest engagement:** Event promotions and posts with concrete numbers (40% improvement, $5.2M savings, 30% boost)
- **Lowest engagement:** Generic "AI is about people" messaging without specifics
- **Comment engagement is near-zero** — no posts are driving conversation
- **CTA pattern:** Every post ends with "Comment [KEYWORD] below" — appears to generate zero actual keyword comments

### Recurring Themes (All 10 Posts)
1. "AI success is about people, not technology" — **literally every single post**
2. Fortune 500 / military case studies (U.S. Air Force mentioned 2x)
3. Organizational readiness, culture, trust
4. "Comment [KEYWORD]" CTA formula
5. Enterprise leaders as target audience

### Tone Assessment
- Corporate consulting voice, polished but generic
- Repetitive — reads like the same blog post repackaged 10 different ways
- No personality, no humor, no edge
- Heavy on "what to think" — zero "what to do"

## Content Gap Confirmed: No Tactical Teaching

Data Society posts ABOUT AI training but never DOES any AI training in their content.

Across 10 posts:
- 0 prompting tips
- 0 data quality guidance
- 0 step-by-step how-tos
- 0 tool-specific advice
- 0 quick wins for individual contributors
- 0 posts targeting anyone below director level

**Biggest untouched gap: Data Quality & AI Fundamentals**

They're called "Data Society" and don't have a single post helping someone understand why their AI output was garbage. This maps directly to Grey AI's Pillar #1.

## Opportunity for Grey AI

**Draft angle:** The "I tried AI and it gave me garbage" experience → the problem is almost always your data/prompt, not the AI. A micro-lesson format that actually TEACHES something (unlike anything Data Society publishes) and targets the individual contributor who's been told to "use AI" but isn't getting useful results.

This positions Grey AI as the company that shows, not tells.
