# Tier 1 Competitor Research — February 14, 2026

## Correlation One
**Posting frequency:** ~1-2x/month organic, heavy on event/program promo
**Engagement range:** 14-366 reactions

### Top Performer
- "They told you to get a degree, land a stable job..." (366 reactions, 77 comments, 29 reposts)
- Provocative career-disruption take — degrees becoming obsolete, AI changing the playbook
- Ended with "AI won't replace you. But someone using AI more effectively than you absolutely will."
- This is their ONLY post with real engagement. Everything else is 14-36 reactions.

### Content Themes
1. DoD Cyber Sentinel Skills Challenge (repeated 5+ times — diminishing returns)
2. Graduate success stories (Amazon Career Choice, workforce development)
3. APEX AI Launchpad for high school students
4. International workforce development (Jordan convening)
5. Digital apprenticeships white paper

### Tone
Corporate-inspirational. Heavy on institutional language ("workforce readiness," "economic resilience"). The breakout post broke this pattern with a direct, provocative voice — that's what worked.

### What Works / What Doesn't
- **Works:** Provocative career takes, specific stats (20K assessed, 4K trained, $5.2M saved)
- **Doesn't work:** Repeating the same Cyber Sentinel promo 6 times, vague institutional language

## Data Society
**Posting frequency:** Daily (aggressive)
**Engagement range:** 1-4 reactions (very low despite high volume)

### Content Formula (used on literally every post)
1. Open with a question or problem statement
2. "Many organizations..." paragraph
3. Vague Fortune 500 case study
4. "The takeaway: AI isn't about tools, it's about people"
5. End with question + keyword CTA ("Comment 'READY'", "Comment 'Adopt'", "Comment 'AIimpact'")

### Content Themes (all basically the same message)
1. AI strategy needs clarity, not trend-chasing
2. AI adoption fails because of people, not technology
3. Training must be hands-on and embedded in workflows
4. Trust in AI must be built through culture and governance
5. Debunking AI adoption myths

### Tone
Corporate thought leadership. Repetitive. Every post sounds like the same LinkedIn ghostwriter. Zero personality. Zero humor. Zero specificity.

### What Works / What Doesn't
- **Works:** Nothing is getting meaningful engagement
- **Doesn't work:** Same message every day, vague "Fortune 500 client" stories, keyword CTAs that feel spammy, never teaching HOW to do anything (only talks ABOUT doing things)

## LearnQuest
**Posting frequency:** 3-4x/week
**Engagement range:** 1-18 reactions

### Content Themes
1. HashiCorp Vault/Terraform training promotion
2. AWS cloud skills training
3. IBM hybrid cloud training
4. EC-Council cybersecurity certification
5. Generative AI executive webinars

### Tone
Dry, professional, transactional. "Here's a problem. Here's our course. Click the link."

### What Works / What Doesn't
- **Works:** The EC-Council award post (18 reactions) — external validation drives slightly more engagement
- **Doesn't work:** Pure product promotion with no educational value in the post itself

## Kendall AI
**Status:** No posts found. Possibly inactive on LinkedIn or using a different company slug.

## Gaps & Opportunities for Grey AI

### 1. Voice Differentiation (MASSIVE gap)
Every competitor sounds corporate. Nobody sounds like a real human who actually uses AI. Grey AI's "smart friend" voice would stand out immediately. Correlation One's ONE breakout post proves provocative, conversational content wins — and none of them can sustain it.

### 2. Practical, Tactical Content
Data Society talks ABOUT AI adoption endlessly but never teaches anyone HOW to do anything. No prompting tips, no micro-automations, no "try this today" takeaways. Grey AI can own the "here's what to actually do" lane.

### 3. Cultural Moment Tie-ins
Nobody is doing timely, culture-relevant content. Valentine's Day, pop culture references, current events — this is free engagement that competitors leave on the table.

### 4. Humor & Personality
Zero humor across all competitors. Everything is dead-serious corporate speak. Even a little wit goes far on LinkedIn.

### 5. Individual Practitioner Focus
Competitors target "organizations" and "leaders." Grey AI can speak directly to the person reading — the individual contributor, the manager who's overwhelmed, the clinician who's skeptical.

### 6. Healthcare AI Niche
None of the Tier 1 competitors touch healthcare AI literacy. This is an uncontested lane for Grey AI.

### 7. Engagement-Driven Formats
Data Society's keyword CTAs are failing. Correlation One's genuine questions work. Grey AI should ask real questions that people actually want to answer, not "Comment 'READY' for resources."
