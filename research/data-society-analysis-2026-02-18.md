- Email preference/opt-in posts
- Posts with "Comment [KEYWORD]" CTAs

## Dominant Themes (ranked by frequency)

1. **"AI fails because of people, not tech"** — Appears in ~15 of ~30 posts. Extremely repetitive.
2. **AI governance & responsible adoption** — Frameworks, guardrails, accountability
3. **Enterprise AI strategy alignment** — "Start with the mission, not the model"
4. **AI advisory services promotion** — New service line, pushed heavily
5. **AI readiness report promotion** — Multiple posts driving to download
6. **Data literacy / data storytelling** — "Data doesn't make decisions, people do"
7. **Custom/tailored training** — Role-specific, hands-on, instructor-led
8. **Extreme weather / crisis readiness** — Niche use case with utility sector
9. **SAT prep** — Bizarre, off-brand content (appears 2x)

## Tone & Style Analysis

- **Corporate-consultative** — reads like a consulting firm's blog, not a LinkedIn feed
- **Repetitive** — the same core message recycled 15+ different ways
- **No personality** — zero humor, zero vulnerability, zero individual voice
- **All top-down** — every post addresses C-suite/executives, never practitioners
- **"Comment [KEYWORD]" CTAs everywhere** — "AIimpact," "READY," "Adopt," "Align," "Discuss" — none of these generate engagement
- **Recycled examples** — U.S. Air Force, the bank AI note-taker story, and "Fortune 500 client saw 30% improvement" appear repeatedly
- **Video content outperforms text** — but they don't lean into it

## Engagement Patterns

**What gets engagement:**
- Named real people with titles and faces
- Video/webinar content
- Posts with genuine personality (the Catie Maillard repost)
- Specific, verifiable numbers
- Industry-specific angles (utilities, healthcare)

**What gets ignored:**
- Generic "AI adoption is about people" platitudes (their bread and butter)
- "Comment [KEYWORD]" engagement bait
- Off-topic content (SAT prep)
- Long posts that repeat the same message as 10 other posts

## Content Gaps (What Data Society Does NOT Cover)

### 1. Practical, tactical AI skills for individuals
They say "upskill your teams" but never show what a 15-minute skill-building exercise looks like. Zero prompting tips, zero "try this today" content.

### 2. The "told to use AI, given no guidance" experience
They address the C-suite making strategy decisions but completely ignore the team lead who got a Slack message saying "start using AI in your workflow" with zero support.

### 3. How to actually question AI/data outputs
They promote "Data doesn't make decisions, people do" as a webinar topic but never publish tactical content teaching people HOW to catch bad AI outputs or question data.

### 4. AI ethics at the individual level
Governance frameworks for enterprises, yes. But "should I paste client data into ChatGPT?" — never addressed.

### 5. Real personality and relatability
Their highest-engagement content comes from individual voices (Catie Maillard), but their own company posts are corporate platitudes on repeat.

## The Biggest Gap: Strategy Platitudes vs. Monday Morning Reality

Data Society's entire content strategy can be summarized as: **"AI adoption is about people, not technology. Invest in training. Build governance. Align with business goals."**

They say this 15 different ways per month. But they NEVER:
- Give someone a specific thing to try
- Acknowledge the frustration of the person receiving these platitudes
- Show what "investing in people" actually looks like in practice
- Address the gap between "we have an AI strategy" and "I still don't know what to do at 9am on Monday"

**Grey AI's opportunity:** Be the brand that fills the space between Data Society's enterprise strategy advice and the actual human sitting at a desk wondering what AI can do for them TODAY.
