- **Date:** 02/11/2026
- **Format:** 8-page carousel + Harvard research reference
- **Impressions:** 137 | **Clicks:** 56 | **Likes:** 0 | **Comments:** 1 | **Reposts:** 1
- **Pillar:** Human-AI Collaboration
- **Hook:** Curiosity gap — "swipe to see what Harvard found"
- **Why it worked:** Carousel swipes inflate click count (56 clicks!), Harvard credibility marker, binary "two mistakes" framework creates self-identification, Valentine's tie-in made it timely and shareable. Question CTA: "Which mistake do you see more often?"

### #2 — "You and AI are in a toxic relationship." (25.0% ER)
- **Date:** 02/13/2026
- **Format:** 3-page carousel ("IT'S COMPLICATED")
- **Impressions:** 56 | **Clicks:** 10 | **Likes:** 3 | **Comments:** 1 | **Reposts:** 0
- **Pillar:** Human-AI Collaboration
- **Hook:** Provocative metaphor — "toxic relationship" with AI
- **Why it worked:** Emotionally charged hook, Type 1 vs Type 2 binary framework, Valentine's Day concept ("It's Complicated"), relatable personas, concise carousel (3 pages). Question CTA: "What's your AI relationship status?"

### #3 — "New training just dropped." (24.7% ER)

- **Impressions:** 243 | **Clicks:** 56 | **Likes:** 3 | **Comments:** 0 | **Reposts:** 1
- **Pillar:** AI Literacy for Leaders & Teams (product launch)
- **Hook:** Bold unicode headline + counterpositioning ("everyone talks disruption, we build the counter-move")
- **Why it worked:** Carousel drove 56 clicks (swipes), "sneak peek" tease created curiosity, product reveal gave concrete reason to engage, 243 impressions = 3rd highest reach ever. Combined reach + engagement = best all-around post.

### #4 — "ChatGPT just got a major glow-up" (11.8% ER)
- **Date:** 09/09/2025
- **Format:** Text post — ChatGPT feature breakdown

## Honorable Mentions — High Reach

| Post | Date | Impressions | ER | Why it reached |
|------|------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| "Most companies still vet vendors like it's 2015" | 06/12/2025 | **343** | 5.5% | Highest reach ever. B2B pain point, bold take, vendor audience. |
| "Accenture just cut 11,000 jobs" | 10/03/2025 | **276** | 5.1% | News-jacking a major layoff event. Fear + relevance. |
| "AI safety for kids / OpenAI parental controls" | 10/07/2025 | **206** | 3.4% | Parent audience + OpenAI brand name = reach boost. |
| "Three schools. Three principals." | 09/04/2025 | **193** | 6.2% | Personal founder story. Relatable chaos. |

## Patterns the Winners Share

### 1. Carousels dominate engagement rate
The top 3 posts by ER are ALL carousels. LinkedIn counts every swipe as a click, massively boosting engagement rate. But beyond the metric inflation, carousels hold attention longer and create a "committed reader" effect.

**Recommendation:** Make carousels the default format for at least 50% of posts.

### 2. Bold unicode headlines stop the scroll
19 of 23 posts use bold unicode text (𝐋𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬). The posts that DON'T use it ("Is AI safety for kids a priority for you?", "We've been listening", "Three schools") tend to get lower engagement rates despite sometimes high impressions.

**Recommendation:** Keep using bold unicode for the opening line of every post.

### 3. Binary frameworks create self-identification
The two highest-ER posts both use a "two types" structure:
- "Two professionals. Two opposite mistakes."
- "Type 1: codependent. Type 2: avoidant."

This forces readers to categorize themselves, which drives comments and shares.

**Recommendation:** Use more binary/dichotomy frameworks: Before/After, Type A vs Type B, "most people do X, the best do Y."

### 4. Provocative emotional hooks > informational hooks
- "Toxic relationship" (25% ER) vs "September is back-to-school season" (5.8% ER)
- "Prove your adaptability. Or risk being cut." (8.9% ER) vs "Homework time, not screen time" (4.7% ER)

Posts that create tension, fear, or curiosity in the first line dramatically outperform informational openers.

**Recommendation:** Lead with tension, not information. First 2 lines should create an emotional response.

### 5. Timely cultural tie-ins boost shareability
- Valentine's Day posts (Feb 2026) = highest engagement period ever
- Accenture layoffs (Oct 2025) = 2nd highest impressions
- ChatGPT feature drop (Sep 2025) = high ER despite low reach
- CES / back-to-school = moderate boosts

**Recommendation:** Plan content around cultural moments, AI news events, and seasonal hooks.

### 6. Question CTAs drive the only comments
Posts with comments (4 out of 23 posts total) ALL end with a direct question:
- "What's your AI relationship status?"
- "Which mistake do you see more often?"
- Week at a glance got a comment (had relatable content)
- "Set it, hear it" got a comment (practical parenting tip)

22 of 23 posts have 0 comments. Questions fix this.

**Recommendation:** End EVERY post with a specific, answerable question.

### 7. News-jacking punches above weight class
Posts referencing specific news (Accenture layoffs, ChatGPT features, OpenAI parental controls) get higher impressions because they ride trending search terms and hashtags.

**Recommendation:** React to AI news within 24 hours with a Grey AI take.

## What Underperforms

### Holiday/themed gimmicks without substance
- **Halloween SPARK Path post** (10/21/2025): 179 impressions but only **1.1% ER** — the worst performing post. The ghost/goblin theme was cute but didn't deliver value or create tension.

### Pure product/service descriptions
- **"Most companies don't know how to find AI talent"** (06/11/2025): 191 impressions, **3.1% ER**. Product-first posts without a hook feel like ads.
- **"Many AI companies talk. We build."** (06/10/2025): 128 impressions, **7.0% ER**. Better because of the provocative opener, but still product-heavy.

### Repetitive parenting micro-tips (Sep 2025 series)
The back-to-school series (Sep 5–12) posted daily parenting AI tips. While individually decent (~5-9% ER), they:
- Got progressively fewer impressions (173 → 146 → 130 → 127 → 111 → 107 → 95 → 93 → 68 → 64)
- Showed clear audience fatigue from daily posting on the same narrow topic
- Targeted parents instead of the core B2B professional audience

## Content Evolution Timeline

| Period | Theme | Avg ER | Avg Impressions | Verdict |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Jun 2025 | B2B vendor/talent (2 posts) | 4.3% | 267 | High reach, low engagement — too corporate |
| Aug 2025 | Product reveals (1 post) | 9.8% | 163 | Good — authenticity works |
| Sep 2025 | Back-to-school parenting (12 posts) | 6.4% | 115 | Moderate — audience fatigue from volume |
| Oct 2025 | AI news + workforce (4 posts) | 4.4% | 193 | High reach, low engagement — missing hooks |
| Nov 2025 | Product launch carousel (1 post) | 24.7% | 243 | Excellent — carousel + product reveal |
| Feb 2026 | Valentine's campaign (2 posts) | 33.7% | 97 | Highest ER ever — frameworks + carousels |

**Key insight:** The page is improving. The Feb 2026 posts (33.7% avg ER) are 5x better than the Sep 2025 average (6.4%). The shift to carousel formats, binary frameworks, and emotional hooks is working. Impressions are lower in Feb — but that's likely because of the 3-month posting gap (Nov–Feb) which reset algorithmic momentum.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Post consistently** — The Nov-to-Feb gap killed momentum. Aim for 3-4x/week minimum.
2. **Carousel-first strategy** — At least 2 carousels per week. They 3-5x engagement rate.
3. **Lead with tension** — Every post needs a hook that creates curiosity, fear, or "wait, what?" in the first 2 lines.
4. **Binary frameworks** — Use "Two types," "Before/After," "Most people vs. the best" at least 1x/week.
5. **End with questions** — Every single post should end with a specific question to drive comments.
6. **News-jack weekly** — React to 1 AI news story per week with a Grey AI perspective.
7. **Retire pure product posts** — Always wrap product mentions in a story or insight framework.
8. **Stay professional** — The B2B/workforce AI literacy content outperforms parenting content for this audience.
