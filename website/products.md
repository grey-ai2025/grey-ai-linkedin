## SPARK Paths™ ($249 each)

Each path = 3 trainings, 10-15 min each, SPARK Score™ aligned.
Research-backed sources: Harvard, McKinsey, Stanford, NIST.

| # | Path Name | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **AI Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving** | Disciplined output review. Minimize systemic risk, reduce hallucinations with RAG, fact-check outputs, spot bias. Final work is credible, defensible, leadership-ready. |
| 2 | **Data Literacy & Decision-Making** | Data quality and unification. Spot/correct accuracy, completeness, consistency issues. Clean and prepare data. Align structures across teams. |
| 3 | **AI Foundations & Conceptual Literacy** | Core distinctions and prompting basics. Separate AI from automation, design structured prompts, apply zero/one/few-shot patterns. |
| 4 | **Practical AI Tool Usage** | Tool-choice confidence. Match AI assistants, copilots, automation platforms, and file formats to the right tasks. |
| 5 | **AI Ethics & Governance** | Bias awareness and governance discipline. Recognize unfair patterns, apply responsible AI principles, build governance programs. |
| 6 | **Attitude & Adaptability Mindset** | Adaptive thinking for AI change. Flex strategies, cultivate AI-first mindset, invest in readiness. |
| 7 | **Tech Learning Strategies** | Lasting tech learning habits. Daily practice routines, sandbox experimentation (Copilot/ChatGPT), feedback-rich resources. |
| 8 | **AI Collaboration & Workflow Integration** | Human-AI workflow mastery. Co-author effectively, add checkpoints, orchestrate multi-step processes. |
